# DigitalAudioVisualizer
Forget the days when you couldn't see your music. Introducing my real-time, FFT-powered audio visualizer that transforms your microphone input into a live frequency-domain light show on VGA (because who needs expensive pre-built visualizers when you can build your own from scratch in SystemVerilog?). In all seriousness, this was one of the most fun and technically challenging projects I worked on, combining digital signal processing, FPGA hardware design, and real-time graphics to create something that actually works end-to-end.

## Fun parts about working on a team

While much of my growth was technical, the project also strengthened the friendships I had with my partners. We spent hours in the IEEE lab thinking, talking, and implementing, and were able to balance the stress with laughter and shared meals.

Some highlights:

- Late-night lab sessions in the IEEE lab, debugging FFT stages and VGA timing while brainstorming solutions
- Conversations while eating international food on the lawn at Ronald Reagan Hospital
- Thoughts about working on an off-shore oil rig if nothing works out for us — joking about future careers and imagining life on the rigs
- Turning frustrating bugs into inside jokes and shared memories 
- Collaborative problem-solving — hours spent whiteboarding, discussing trade-offs, and iterating on designs together

It was a great time.
